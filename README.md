# Eurus Growth Lab

This repository documents **growth & analytics experiments** for *[Eurus Concept](https://eurusconcept.com/)*.  
All cases are built on **synthetic data** and are designed to demonstrate how  
modern growth teams run diagnostics, design experiments, and drive decisions  
using analytics tools and experimentation frameworks.  

## Tools in Use
- **GA4 + GTM** → Event & funnel tracking  
- **Hotjar** → Heatmaps & session recordings  
- **Looker Studio** → Funnel dashboards, CAC/ROAS visualization  
- **Make & Zapier** → Automation & integrations  
- **GitHub** → Repository for all reports and documentation
  

## EXPERIMENTS

# Experiment_1:
-Case overview: Funnel conversion, bottlenecks (checkout drop-off), CAC & ROAS insights
-Documentatiom: [Eurus-Concept---Growth-Funnel-Optimization-Project](EXP1/)  
-Tool's used: GA4, GTM, Hotjar, [Looker Studio](https://lookerstudio.google.com/reporting/da2d8565-3fbd-4b12-8324-87f5cf138ba4), 

- 

## Notes
- All reports are **experimental** and based on real&synthetic combined datasets.  
- Concepts such as **ICE framework, guardrails, multi-armed bandits, response curves, seasonality, and attribution models**  
are applied and explained within each experiment’s documentation.
