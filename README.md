# Eurus Growth Lab

This repository documents **growth & analytics experiments** for *[Eurus Concept](https://eurusconcept.com/)*.  
All cases are built on **synthetic data** and are designed to demonstrate how  
modern growth teams run diagnostics, design experiments, and drive decisions  
using analytics tools and experimentation frameworks.  

## Case Subjects/Problems:

- Funnel & Acquisition


*EXP1. In GA4 funnel analysis, you detect a 30% drop-off at checkout. How would you use Hotjar signals to diagnose friction and propose fixes?
-Case overview: Funnel conversion, bottlenecks (checkout drop-off), CAC & ROAS insights
-Documentatiom: [Eurus-Concept---Growth-Funnel-Optimization-Project](EXP1/)  
-Tool's used: GA4, GTM, Hotjar, [Looker Studio](https://lookerstudio.google.com/reporting/da2d8565-3fbd-4b12-8324-87f5cf138ba4), 


2. Paid Search campaigns show strong last-click ROAS, but geo-holdouts reveal weak incrementality. How would you reallocate budgets to maximize iCAC efficiency?

3. Using ICE scoring, how would you prioritize 10 competing growth hypotheses? Show a sample calculation.

4. Your Looker Studio dashboard shows CAC rising while CTR is flat. What guardrail metrics would you define and what action would you take?

5. What Make/Zapier automations would you set up to reduce manual work in paid acquisition reporting?

- Attribution & Measurement

6. When last-click, position-based, and time-decay attribution models report different ROAS, which would you rely on for portfolio decisions and why?

7. How would you use ghost ads in Paid Social to measure incrementality?

8. To reduce over-attribution risk, which methods (e.g., PSA, CUPED, synthetic control) would you implement?

9. How would you de-seasonalize data to uncover true performance trends?

10. How would you apply a response curve analysis to detect diminishing returns and set budget caps?

- Experimentation & Testing

11. While testing two checkout messages, how would you use a two-proportion z-test to make a decision?

12. How would you apply a factorial design to test product page layout × promotion message combinations?

13. With multi-armed bandit, how would you allocate traffic across three creative variants?

14. How would you redesign decision rules to avoid peeking in sequential testing?

15. How would you use a feature flag to safely roll out a new checkout experience?

- Retention & Lifecycle

16. How would you design RFM segmentation and behavioral triggers for lifecycle marketing automation?

17. To mitigate churn, what leading metrics and surrogate metrics would you track?

18. Using Stripe transaction data, how would you calculate LTV by cohorts and compare it against CAC?

19. Hotjar exit surveys reveal high complaints about shipping fees. How would you measure its impact on acquisition and retention metrics?

20. During channel expansion (e.g., affiliates), how would you redesign attribution and define guardrails?

## Tools in Use
- **GA4 + GTM** → Event & funnel tracking  
- **Hotjar** → Heatmaps & session recordings  
- **Looker Studio** → Funnel dashboards, CAC/ROAS visualization  
- **Make & Zapier** → Automation & integrations  
- **GitHub** → Repository for all reports and documentation
  

## EXPERIMENTS

# Experiment_1:
-Case overview: Funnel conversion, bottlenecks (checkout drop-off), CAC & ROAS insights
-Documentatiom: [Eurus-Concept---Growth-Funnel-Optimization-Project](EXP1/)  
-Tool's used: GA4, GTM, Hotjar, [Looker Studio](https://lookerstudio.google.com/reporting/da2d8565-3fbd-4b12-8324-87f5cf138ba4),

## Notes
- All reports are **experimental** and based on real&synthetic combined datasets.  
- Concepts such as **ICE framework, guardrails, multi-armed bandits, response curves, seasonality, and attribution models**  
are applied and explained within each experiment’s documentation.
